CanvasParallax
==============

HTML canvas parallax scrolling demo.

This is an older demo. It was a prototype for a next-gen interface for OtakuBooty.

If I was doing it today, I'd probably:

- Not use HTML Canvas; immediate-mode drawing doesn't take advantage of hardware acceleration too well. Would probably use CSS transitions instead?
- Would use sprite sheets to reduce the # of requests sent "over the wire"
- Drink a little harder
